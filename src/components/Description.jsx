            I am an ambitious final year computer science student at a University of Economics in Katowice, and an experienced software developer. My passions are centered around creating innovative solutions using .NET technology.
            My skills include designing and implementing desktop and web applications, database development and solving complex programming problems. I always strive for excellence in every project, taking care of code quality and usability of the final product.
            When Iâ€™m not programming I am working out, sailing or hanging out with my friends.
